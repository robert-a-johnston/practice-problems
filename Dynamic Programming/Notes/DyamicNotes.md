# Dynamic Programming
## Process
  - calculate brute force
  - Test for efficiency - large numbers, edge cases
  - Draw problem for smallish example
  - look for similar patterns in drawing
  - find base cases
  - make problem size smaller
  - ### Memoization
    - store duplicate patterns 
      - in javascript can use objects
      - example javascript fib or stair climber
        - add empty memo object into arguments
        - save pattern in fib object
    - STRATEGY
      - 1. MAKE IT WORK
        - visualize problem as a tree
        - implement the tree using recursion
        - test it (the brute force for large numbers may be slow)
      - 2. MAKE IT EFFICIENT
        - add memo object = has keys and values
        - add a base case to return memo values
        - store return values into the memo
  - Examples
    - canSum -> decision problem (boolean, can you do it)
    - howSum -> combinatorial problem (how will you do it)
    - bestSum -> optimization (best way to do it)
  - ### Tabulation
    - Building a table
      - table should be about the length of the input (usually array with length is + 1 of input int: n = 6, table.length = 7)
      - set array elements to default like 0 for running sum
